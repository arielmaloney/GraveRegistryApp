# GraveRegistryApp
Grave Registry Android Application

This application was created as a final school project during a Practicum.
Its purpose is to create a platform for volunteers to submit veteran grave marker data to a database without the need to use
a paper and pencil method that requires manual insertion to a database. It also provides a user the ability
to verify information as accurate, suggest changes to inaccurate data, and view their past submissions.

The entire Android Studio project is available as well as the additional PHP files needed for database to application communication.
